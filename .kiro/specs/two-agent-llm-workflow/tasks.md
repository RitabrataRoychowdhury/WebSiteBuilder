# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create core LLM service interface and provider implementations
  - Implement the base `LLMService` interface with standardized methods for completion generation, response validation, and provider information
  - Create `OpenRouterService` class implementing the interface with proper API integration using the provided curl example
  - Extend existing `GeminiService` to implement the unified interface while maintaining backward compatibility
  - Add comprehensive error handling with custom error types and retry logic with exponential backoff
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Build workflow orchestrator and agent services
  - Implement `WorkflowOrchestrator` class to manage the two-agent workflow execution
  - Create `CodingAgent` service with structured prompts for code generation following clean architecture principles
  - Develop `ReviewingAgent` service with prompts focused on code quality, performance, and maintainability analysis
  - Integrate provider fallback mechanism and error recovery strategies within the orchestrator
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Implement centralized prompt management system
  - Create `PromptManager` class for storing and retrieving role-aware prompt templates
  - Design prompt templates for coding agent with coding style rules and expected output formats
  - Build prompt templates for reviewing agent with structured critique and improvement guidelines
  - Add prompt variable substitution and validation functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 4. Develop frontend integration and user interface
  - Create React components for coding task submission extending existing UI patterns
  - Build workflow result display components showing original code, review notes, and improved code
  - Integrate with existing service layer patterns and type system from `src/types/index.ts`
  - Add loading states, error handling, and user feedback for the two-agent workflow process
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Add comprehensive testing and configuration management
  - Write unit tests for all service classes using existing Vitest setup with mocked LLM providers
  - Create integration tests for complete workflow execution with real provider fallback scenarios
  - Implement configuration management for API keys and provider settings extending existing `.env.example` pattern
  - Add performance monitoring and metrics collection for workflow execution tracking
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 5.3, 5.4_
