# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a two-agent LLM coding workflow system that separates code generation from code review responsibilities. The system uses a primary Coding Agent to generate production-ready code and a secondary Reviewing Agent to critique and improve the generated code. The architecture emphasizes extensibility, clean design patterns, and robust error handling to support multiple LLM providers through a unified interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to submit a coding task and receive high-quality, reviewed code through an automated two-agent workflow, so that I can get production-ready implementations with built-in quality assurance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a coding task THEN the system SHALL route the request to the Coding Agent first
2. WHEN the Coding Agent completes code generation THEN the system SHALL automatically pass the code to the Reviewing Agent
3. WHEN the Reviewing Agent completes its review THEN the system SHALL return both the improved code and structured review notes
4. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the system SHALL provide a final result containing the reviewed code and improvement suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a unified LLM service interface that supports multiple providers, so that I can easily add new LLM providers without modifying core business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating a new LLM provider THEN the system SHALL only require creating a new service implementation without touching existing core logic
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use a common interface regardless of the underlying provider
3. WHEN a provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL support fallback to alternative providers through the unified interface
4. IF a new provider needs to be added THEN the system SHALL follow the Open/Closed Principle from SOLID design patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API failures, so that temporary network issues don't cause my coding workflow to fail completely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN an LLM returns malformed output THEN the system SHALL validate the response and request a retry if needed
3. WHEN maximum retries are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message to the user
4. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a prompt engineer, I want a centralized prompt management system with role-aware templates, so that I can maintain consistent, high-quality prompts across different agents and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating code THEN the Coding Agent SHALL use structured prompts that include coding style rules and expected output format
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN the Reviewing Agent SHALL use prompts that focus on correctness, performance, and maintainability analysis
3. WHEN prompts need updates THEN the system SHALL allow modification without changing agent logic
4. WHEN new prompt templates are needed THEN the system SHALL support easy addition of context-rich, role-aware prompts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the workflow to be limited to 4-5 manageable tasks, so that the implementation remains focused and deliverable within reasonable timeframes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN breaking down the implementation THEN the system SHALL be designed with no more than 5 main tasks
2. WHEN tasks have subtasks THEN the total complexity SHALL remain manageable and focused
3. WHEN planning implementation THEN each task SHALL be clearly defined and independently testable
4. WHEN reviewing the task breakdown THEN the scope SHALL be realistic for a single development cycle
