# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the Unsplash API into the AI website builder to dynamically fetch relevant images based on website prompts and section titles. The system will replace placeholder image icons with real, high-quality images while maintaining UI performance through optimized loading strategies and caching mechanisms. The architecture follows extensible design patterns to support future image provider integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user generating websites, I want placeholder images to be automatically replaced with relevant real images from Unsplash, so that my generated websites look professional and complete without manual image sourcing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a website is generated THEN the system SHALL analyze the website content and section titles to determine relevant image queries
2. WHEN placeholder images are detected THEN the system SHALL fetch appropriate images from Unsplash API based on content context
3. WHEN images are fetched THEN the system SHALL replace placeholder `<img>` tags with actual Unsplash image URLs
4. WHEN the website generation completes THEN all placeholder images SHALL be replaced with contextually relevant real images

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an extensible image provider system using industry-grade design patterns, so that I can easily add other image APIs like Pexels or Pixabay in the future without modifying core logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the image service THEN the system SHALL use Factory or Strategy pattern for provider abstraction
2. WHEN adding new image providers THEN the system SHALL only require creating new provider implementations without touching existing code
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use a unified interface regardless of the underlying image provider
4. IF a new provider needs integration THEN the system SHALL follow the Open/Closed Principle from SOLID design patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to remain fast and responsive when images are being fetched, so that the website generation process doesn't feel slow or heavy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are being fetched THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive and not block user interactions
2. WHEN API calls are slow THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading or progressive image loading strategies
3. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide fallback placeholder images to maintain layout integrity
4. WHEN the same images are requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL implement caching to avoid redundant API calls
