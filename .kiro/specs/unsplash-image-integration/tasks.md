# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create Unsplash service and image provider infrastructure
  - Implement the base `ImageProvider` interface with standardized methods for image search and URL generation
  - Create `UnsplashService` class implementing the interface with proper API integration using the provided credentials
  - Build `ImageProviderFactory` using Factory pattern to support future providers like Pexels and Pixabay
  - Add comprehensive error handling with custom error types, rate limiting, and retry logic for API failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Implement image processing and caching system
  - Create `ImageProcessorService` to analyze website content and extract relevant image queries from HTML and WebsiteRequest
  - Build `ImageCacheManager` with memory and localStorage caching to avoid redundant API calls and improve performance
  - Implement `QueryExtractor` to intelligently derive search terms from website titles, descriptions, features, and HTML content
  - Add `FallbackHandler` with SVG placeholder generation for failed image loads to maintain layout integrity
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.4, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Integrate with existing website generation and add performance optimizations
  - Extend `generateWebsite` function in `geminiApi.ts` to include image processing workflow without breaking existing functionality
  - Implement lazy loading and progressive image loading strategies to keep UI responsive during image fetching
  - Add configuration management for Unsplash API credentials and processing settings in environment variables
  - Create comprehensive unit tests for all service classes and integration tests for the complete image processing workflow
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2_
